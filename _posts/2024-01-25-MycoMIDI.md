Every so often when I'm dealing with a lot of stress I end up making [strange projects](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Strange_mood). I had a dream where I had synesthesia, movements of muscles and joints had distinct sounds and actions like walking or running played different melodies. As a result I ended up learning about human nerve action potentials and their electrical spikes.

Inspiration
======
My goal was to turn bioelectrical signals into "music" of a sort, attaching electrodes to myself would be quite uncomfortable long term but I was already growing Oyster and Lions Mane mushrooms for food.

Hardware
======
On a whim I pulled a retired mycelium block from the compost and hooked some electrodes to it. The signals were barely noticable on an oscilloscope so an amplifier was needed, enter the [BioAmp-EXG-Pill](https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/BioAmp-EXG-Pill)!

With the amplification sorted out the signal needed to be converted into a MIDI signal, a Raspberry pi and ADS1256 ADC was pulled from the parts bin with each channel assigned to an amp.
